# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' *.stripe.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: *.amazonaws.com`
- XSS Prevention: Input sanitization, React's built-in XSS protection, Content Security Policy enforcement
- Secure Storage: Encrypted secure storage for tokens (iOS Keychain, Android Keystore), no sensitive data in AsyncStorage

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Joi schema validation for all API endpoints, SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Rate Limiting: API Gateway throttling at 1000 requests/minute per user, progressive rate limiting for abuse detection
- CORS Policy: Restricted to known frontend domains, credentials allowed only for authenticated requests

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: Secure HTTP-only cookies for web, encrypted storage for mobile, automatic token rotation
- Session Management: AWS Cognito managed sessions with configurable timeout, device tracking for security monitoring
- Password Policy: Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements, bcrypt hashing with salt rounds

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: < 2MB initial bundle for mobile, < 1MB for web with code splitting
- Loading Strategy: Lazy loading for non-critical screens, prefetching for likely user paths, progressive image loading
- Caching Strategy: React Query for API response caching, service worker for static assets, optimistic updates for better UX

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: < 200ms for simple queries, < 1s for complex operations including payment processing
- Database Optimization: Connection pooling, query optimization with EXPLAIN ANALYZE, strategic indexing on frequently queried fields
- Caching Strategy: Redis for session data and frequently accessed business listings, CloudFront for static assets, API Gateway response caching
