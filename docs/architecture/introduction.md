# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Buy Locals, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield project**

The Buy Locals platform is a greenfield project designed from scratch to meet the specific requirements of a community-driven local business marketplace. While we will leverage existing open-source libraries and frameworks, no specific starter template constrains the architectural decisions.
