## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.2 (Location-Based Discovery) established the foundation for location-aware business search. This story builds upon that with advanced text search, filtering, and user experience enhancements.

### Database Full-Text Search Context
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md + database-schema.md]
**PostgreSQL Full-Text Search Implementation:**
```sql
-- Add full-text search columns
ALTER TABLE businesses ADD COLUMN search_vector tsvector;

-- Create full-text search index
CREATE INDEX idx_businesses_search ON businesses USING GIN(search_vector);

-- Update search vector with business data
UPDATE businesses SET search_vector =
  setweight(to_tsvector('english', name), 'A') ||
  setweight(to_tsvector('english', description), 'B') ||
  setweight(to_tsvector('english', array_to_string(categories, ' ')), 'C') ||
  setweight(to_tsvector('english',
    COALESCE((services::jsonb ->> 'name'), '')), 'D');

-- Search query with ranking
SELECT *,
       ts_rank(search_vector, plainto_tsquery('english', $1)) as rank,
       ST_Distance(...) / 1000 as distance_km
FROM businesses
WHERE search_vector @@ plainto_tsquery('english', $1)
  AND is_active = TRUE
ORDER BY rank DESC, distance_km ASC;
```

### Enhanced API Specification Context
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]
**Enhanced Business Search Endpoint:**
```typescript
GET /businesses?search={query}&category={categories}&latitude={lat}&longitude={lng}&radius={miles}&sort={field}&limit={n}&offset={n}

// Search suggestion endpoint
GET /businesses/suggestions?q={partial_query}&location={lat,lng}

// Category aggregation endpoint
GET /businesses/categories?location={lat,lng}&radius={miles}
```

### Business Categories Taxonomy
**Predefined Business Categories:**
```typescript
enum BusinessCategory {
  RESTAURANTS = 'restaurants',
  RETAIL = 'retail',
  SERVICES = 'services',
  HEALTH = 'health',
  AUTOMOTIVE = 'automotive',
  BEAUTY = 'beauty',
  FITNESS = 'fitness',
  ENTERTAINMENT = 'entertainment',
  PROFESSIONAL = 'professional',
  HOME_SERVICES = 'home_services'
}

interface CategoryInfo {
  id: BusinessCategory;
  name: string;
  icon: string;
  subcategories?: string[];
}
```

### Search State Management Context
**Search and Filter State:**
```typescript
interface SearchState {
  query: string;
  categories: BusinessCategory[];
  location: LocationCoordinates | null;
  radius: number;
  sortBy: 'distance' | 'rating' | 'relevance' | 'recent';
  results: BusinessWithDistance[];
  suggestions: SearchSuggestion[];
  filters: SearchFilters;
  isLoading: boolean;
  hasMore: boolean;
}

interface SearchFilters {
  priceRange?: [number, number];
  rating?: number;
  openNow?: boolean;
  hasPhotos?: boolean;
  hasReviews?: boolean;
}
```

### Frontend Component Architecture
```
apps/mobile/src/components/search/
├── SearchBar/              # Main search input with autocomplete
├── FilterPanel/           # Category and advanced filters
├── FilterChip/            # Individual filter display
├── SearchResults/         # Results list with sorting
├── SearchSuggestions/     # Autocomplete suggestions
├── EmptySearchState/      # No results handling
└── index.ts
```

### Search Suggestion Implementation
**Typeahead and Autocomplete Logic:**
```typescript
interface SearchSuggestion {
  type: 'business' | 'category' | 'query';
  text: string;
  subtitle?: string;
  count?: number;
  icon?: string;
}

// Suggestion endpoint logic
const generateSuggestions = async (query: string, location?: Coordinates) => {
  // Business name matches
  const businessMatches = await searchBusinessNames(query, location);

  // Category matches
  const categoryMatches = await searchCategories(query);

  // Popular query matches
  const queryMatches = await getPopularQueries(query, location);

  return [...businessMatches, ...categoryMatches, ...queryMatches];
};
```

### Performance Optimization Context
**Search Performance Requirements:**
- Full-text search with GIN indexes for sub-second responses
- Search result caching with location and filter-based cache keys
- Debounced autocomplete to reduce API calls (300ms delay)
- Pagination with cursor-based or offset-based approaches
- Client-side result caching for back navigation

### Filter UI/UX Patterns
**Filter Interface Design:**
```typescript
// Filter chip component for active filters
interface FilterChipProps {
  label: string;
  onRemove: () => void;
  type: 'location' | 'category' | 'text' | 'custom';
}

// Filter panel with collapsible sections
interface FilterPanelProps {
  categories: CategoryInfo[];
  activeFilters: SearchFilters;
  onFilterChange: (filters: SearchFilters) => void;
  resultCounts: Record<string, number>;
}
```

### Search Analytics Context
**Search Metrics and Insights:**
- Popular search queries by location and time
- Filter usage patterns and combinations
- Search result click-through rates
- Empty search query analysis for business opportunity identification
- Search performance metrics (response time, result quality)

### Empty State Handling
**No Results User Experience:**
```typescript
interface EmptySearchStateProps {
  query: string;
  location: LocationCoordinates;
  onSuggestionSelect: (suggestion: string) => void;
  alternativeBusinesses: Business[];
}

// Empty state suggestions
const generateAlternativeSuggestions = (query: string, location: Coordinates) => {
  return {
    broaderSearch: removeLastWord(query),
    nearbyAlternatives: findSimilarBusinesses(query, location),
    popularInArea: getPopularBusinesses(location),
    categoryExpansion: expandSearchToSimilarCategories(query)
  };
};
```

### Testing Requirements Context
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Search and Filter Tests:**
- `apps/api/tests/functions/business/search.test.ts`
- `apps/mobile/tests/components/SearchBar.test.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/tests/services/searchService.test.ts`

**Test Scenarios:**
- Full-text search with various query types
- Category filtering and combination logic
- Search suggestion generation and ranking
- Filter state management and persistence
- Search performance under load
- Empty state handling and alternative suggestions
- Mobile search UI interaction and accessibility

### Search Result Caching Strategy
**Cache Key Structure:**
```typescript
const generateCacheKey = (params: SearchParams) => {
  const { query, categories, location, radius, sort, filters } = params;
  const locationKey = location ? `${location.lat},${location.lng}` : 'global';
  const filtersKey = createHashFromFilters(filters);

  return `search:${query}:${categories.join(',')}:${locationKey}:${radius}:${sort}:${filtersKey}`;
};

// Cache TTL based on search type
const getCacheTTL = (searchType: string) => {
  switch (searchType) {
    case 'location_based': return 300; // 5 minutes
    case 'category_only': return 900; // 15 minutes
    case 'text_search': return 600; // 10 minutes
    default: return 300;
  }
};
```
