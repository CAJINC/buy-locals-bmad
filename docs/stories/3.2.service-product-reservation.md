## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 3.1 established basic booking infrastructure. This story expands reservation capabilities to handle diverse business types with product inventory, service variations, and complex scheduling requirements.

### Enhanced Reservation Data Model
**Extended Reservation Structure:**
```typescript
interface Reservation extends Booking {
  type: 'service' | 'product' | 'table' | 'consultation' | 'event';
  items?: ReservationItem[];
  requirements?: ServiceRequirements;
  expiresAt?: Date;
  modificationPolicy: ModificationPolicy;
  inventoryHolds: InventoryHold[];
}

interface ReservationItem {
  productId: string;
  quantity: number;
  price: number;
  specifications?: Record<string, any>;
  customizations?: string[];
}

interface ServiceRequirements {
  preparationTime?: number;
  resourceRequirements?: string[];
  prerequisiteDocuments?: string[];
  specialInstructions?: string;
}

interface InventoryHold {
  productId: string;
  quantity: number;
  holdUntil: Date;
  status: 'active' | 'confirmed' | 'expired' | 'released';
}
```

### Product Inventory System
**Inventory Management:**
```typescript
interface ProductInventory {
  id: string;
  businessId: string;
  productId: string;
  totalQuantity: number;
  availableQuantity: number;
  reservedQuantity: number;
  minimumStock: number;
  isTrackingEnabled: boolean;
  lastUpdated: Date;
}

interface InventoryService {
  checkAvailability(productId: string, quantity: number): Promise<boolean>;
  reserveItems(items: ReservationItem[], holdDuration: number): Promise<InventoryHold[]>;
  confirmReservation(holdIds: string[]): Promise<void>;
  releaseHold(holdIds: string[]): Promise<void>;
  updateInventory(productId: string, adjustment: number, reason: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Business Type Adaptations
**Service Type Configurations:**
```typescript
interface ServiceTypeConfig {
  type: 'appointment' | 'consultation' | 'workshop' | 'rental' | 'dining';
  formFields: FormFieldConfig[];
  bookingRules: BookingRules;
  pricingModel: PricingModel;
  requirements: ServiceRequirements;
}

interface FormFieldConfig {
  fieldName: string;
  fieldType: 'text' | 'select' | 'number' | 'date' | 'file' | 'checkbox';
  required: boolean;
  validation?: ValidationRule[];
  options?: SelectOption[];
  conditionalDisplay?: ConditionalLogic;
}

// Example configurations
const restaurantReservation: ServiceTypeConfig = {
  type: 'dining',
  formFields: [
    { fieldName: 'partySize', fieldType: 'number', required: true },
    { fieldName: 'seatingPreference', fieldType: 'select', required: false },
    { fieldName: 'dietaryRestrictions', fieldType: 'text', required: false }
  ],
  bookingRules: {
    advanceBookingDays: 30,
    minimumNotice: 120, // 2 hours
    maxDuration: 180    // 3 hours
  }
};
```

### Dynamic Form Generation
**Adaptive Form Component:**
```typescript
interface AdaptiveReservationFormProps {
  businessType: BusinessType;
  serviceType?: ServiceTypeConfig;
  onSubmit: (reservation: ReservationFormData) => void;
  initialData?: Partial<ReservationFormData>;
}

export const AdaptiveReservationForm: React.FC<AdaptiveReservationFormProps> = ({
  businessType,
  serviceType,
  onSubmit,
  initialData
}) => {
  const formConfig = useFormConfiguration(businessType, serviceType);
  const { control, handleSubmit, watch } = useForm({
    defaultValues: initialData
  });

  return (
    <Form>
      {formConfig.fields.map(field => (
        <DynamicFormField
          key={field.fieldName}
          config={field}
          control={control}
          watchedValues={watch()}
        />
      ))}
    </Form>
  );
};
```

### Reservation Expiration Management
**TTL and Expiration Logic:**
```typescript
interface ExpirationService {
  setReservationTTL(reservationId: string, ttlMinutes: number): Promise<void>;
  checkExpiringReservations(): Promise<Reservation[]>;
  sendExpirationWarnings(): Promise<void>;
  processExpiredReservations(): Promise<void>;
  extendReservation(reservationId: string, additionalMinutes: number): Promise<boolean>;
}

// Automated expiration processing
const processReservationExpirations = async () => {
  const expiringReservations = await reservationService.getExpiringReservations(60); // 1 hour warning

  for (const reservation of expiringReservations) {
    await notificationService.sendExpirationWarning(reservation);
  }

  const expiredReservations = await reservationService.getExpiredReservations();

  for (const reservation of expiredReservations) {
    await inventoryService.releaseHolds(reservation.inventoryHolds.map(h => h.id));
    await reservationService.markAsExpired(reservation.id);
    await notificationService.sendExpirationNotice(reservation);
  }
};
```

### Database Schema Extensions
**Additional Tables for Enhanced Reservations:**
```sql
-- Product inventory tracking
CREATE TABLE product_inventory (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    business_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES businesses(id),
    product_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    total_quantity INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    available_quantity INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    reserved_quantity INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    minimum_stock INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    is_tracking_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Inventory holds for reservations
CREATE TABLE inventory_holds (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    reservation_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES bookings(id),
    product_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    quantity_held INTEGER NOT NULL,
    hold_until TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Service type configurations
CREATE TABLE service_types (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    business_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES businesses(id),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    type_category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    form_config JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    booking_rules JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    pricing_config JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Business Dashboard Enhancements
**Reservation Management Interface:**
```typescript
interface ReservationDashboardProps {
  businessId: string;
  dateRange: [Date, Date];
  filterOptions: ReservationFilters;
}

export const ReservationDashboard: React.FC<ReservationDashboardProps> = ({
  businessId,
  dateRange,
  filterOptions
}) => {
  const reservations = useReservations(businessId, dateRange, filterOptions);
  const inventoryStatus = useInventoryStatus(businessId);

  return (
    <DashboardLayout>
      <ReservationFilters />
      <ReservationCalendar reservations={reservations} />
      <ReservationList
        reservations={reservations}
        onStatusChange={handleStatusChange}
        onModify={handleModification}
      />
      <InventoryOverview inventory={inventoryStatus} />
    </DashboardLayout>
  );
};
```

### Modification Policy Engine
**Reservation Modification Rules:**
```typescript
interface ModificationPolicy {
  allowModification: boolean;
  modificationDeadline: number; // hours before reservation
  modificationFee: number;
  allowedChanges: ModificationScope[];
  requiresApproval: boolean;
  maxModifications: number;
}

interface ModificationScope {
  field: 'time' | 'date' | 'service' | 'quantity' | 'specifications';
  restrictions?: string[];
  additionalFee?: number;
}

const evaluateModificationRequest = (
  reservation: Reservation,
  modification: ModificationRequest,
  policy: ModificationPolicy
): ModificationEvaluation => {
  const timeUntilReservation = reservation.scheduledAt.getTime() - Date.now();
  const deadlineMs = policy.modificationDeadline * 60 * 60 * 1000;

  if (timeUntilReservation < deadlineMs) {
    return { allowed: false, reason: 'Past modification deadline' };
  }

  // Additional validation logic...
  return { allowed: true, fee: calculateModificationFee(modification, policy) };
};
```

### Performance and Concurrency
**Inventory Locking for Concurrent Reservations:**
```typescript
// Pessimistic locking for inventory reservation
const reserveInventoryWithLock = async (items: ReservationItem[]) => {
  return await db.transaction(async (trx) => {
    for (const item of items) {
      const inventory = await trx('product_inventory')
        .where('product_id', item.productId)
        .forUpdate()
        .first();

      if (inventory.available_quantity < item.quantity) {
        throw new Error(`Insufficient inventory for product ${item.productId}`);
      }

      await trx('product_inventory')
        .where('product_id', item.productId)
        .update({
          available_quantity: inventory.available_quantity - item.quantity,
          reserved_quantity: inventory.reserved_quantity + item.quantity
        });

      await trx('inventory_holds').insert({
        product_id: item.productId,
        quantity_held: item.quantity,
        hold_until: new Date(Date.now() + 30 * 60 * 1000) // 30 minute hold
      });
    }
  });
};
```
