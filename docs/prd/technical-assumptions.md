# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo
The project will use a monorepo approach with shared components and utilities across mobile apps, web dashboard, and backend services. This supports consistent code sharing, unified deployment processes, and simplified dependency management across the full stack.

## Service Architecture
**Microservices within Monorepo:** The platform implements a microservices architecture for core functions (user management, payments, notifications, search) while maintaining monorepo benefits for development efficiency. Services communicate via RESTful APIs with GraphQL considered for complex data relationships.

## Testing Requirements
**Full Testing Pyramid:** Implementation includes unit tests for business logic, integration tests for service interactions, and end-to-end tests for critical user journeys. Automated testing covers payment processing, booking workflows, and cross-platform functionality. Manual testing protocols ensure user experience quality across devices and browsers.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Database Strategy:** PostgreSQL as primary database with Redis for caching, session management, and real-time features
- **Third-party Integrations:** Stripe for payment processing, Google Maps for location services, Twilio for SMS notifications, Mixpanel for analytics
- **Hosting Infrastructure:** AWS with auto-scaling capabilities, CDN for media assets, and environment separation for development, staging, and production
- **Security Framework:** JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Performance Optimization:** Image compression and CDN delivery, API response caching, database query optimization
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Comprehensive application monitoring, error tracking, and performance metrics collection
