# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish robust technical foundation with user authentication, core database architecture, and basic API endpoints while delivering initial business listing functionality that provides immediate value and validates the platform concept.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup & Development Environment

As a **developer**,
I want **a fully configured development environment with repository structure, build processes, and deployment pipeline**,
so that **the team can collaborate effectively and deploy code reliably to staging and production environments**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo structure established with separate packages for mobile app, web dashboard, backend API, and shared utilities
2. React Native mobile app project initialized with navigation, state management, and build configuration for iOS and Android
3. React.js web dashboard project configured with responsive design framework and build optimization
4. Node.js/Express backend API structured with environment configuration, middleware setup, and database connection
5. PostgreSQL database provisioned with migration system and Redis cache configuration
6. AWS deployment pipeline configured with staging and production environments
7. ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configured across all packages for code consistency
8. GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline validates tests and deploys to staging on PR merge

## Story 1.2: User Authentication System

As a **consumer or business owner**,
I want **to create an account and securely log into the platform**,
so that **I can access personalized features and maintain my profile information**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Registration flow supports email/password authentication with email verification
2. Login system implements JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation
3. Password reset functionality via email with secure token validation
4. User roles (consumer, business_owner, admin) implemented with role-based access control
5. Profile management allows users to update basic information (name, email, phone, location preferences)
6. Social login integration prepared (Google, Facebook) but not required for MVP
7. Session management maintains login state across app restarts and browser sessions
8. Security measures include password complexity requirements, rate limiting, and account lockout protection

## Story 1.3: Core Database Schema & API Foundation

As a **system**,
I want **a well-structured database schema and RESTful API foundation**,
so that **all platform features can reliably store and retrieve data with proper relationships and data integrity**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. User table structure supports authentication, profile data, and role management
2. Business entity schema includes profile information, location data, categories, and operational details
3. Database relationships properly established with foreign keys and indexes for performance
4. RESTful API endpoints created for user management (CRUD operations, authentication)
5. API documentation generated automatically (Swagger/OpenAPI) with endpoint descriptions and examples
6. Error handling middleware provides consistent error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
7. Request validation implemented using schema validation library (Joi or similar)
8. Database migration system allows for schema updates and rollbacks during development

## Story 1.4: Basic Business Listing Creation

As a **business owner**,
I want **to create a basic business profile with essential information**,
so that **I can establish my digital presence on the platform and be discoverable by local consumers**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Business registration form collects name, description, address, phone, email, website, and business hours
2. Business category selection from predefined list (restaurants, retail, services, health, etc.)
3. Photo upload functionality for business logo and up to 5 additional images
4. Address validation and geocoding integration (Google Maps API) for accurate location data
5. Business profile preview shows how listing will appear to consumers
6. Form validation ensures required fields are completed and data formats are correct
7. Successfully created business profiles are immediately viewable via direct URL
8. Business owner can edit their profile information after initial creation
