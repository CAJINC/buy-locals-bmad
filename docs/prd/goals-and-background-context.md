# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Create a comprehensive local business marketplace that drives measurable community economic impact
- Establish a trusted platform connecting community-conscious consumers with local businesses
- Build scalable technology infrastructure supporting 100+ businesses and 500+ consumers in first 6 months
- Generate $100K GMV within 12 months while maintaining platform sustainability
- Become the primary digital commerce platform for mid-sized communities (100K-500K population)

## Background Context
Based on the established Project Brief, Buy Locals addresses the fundamental disconnect between online shopping convenience and local business support. With 79% of consumers trusting local recommendations but lacking convenient transaction mechanisms, and 59% of local businesses planning increased technology spending, there's a validated market opportunity worth $93B growing at 13.5% CAGR. The platform differentiates from existing solutions by combining community trust mechanisms (like Nextdoor) with full marketplace functionality, focusing on measurable local economic impact rather than pure transactions.
