# Buy Locals Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Create a comprehensive local business marketplace that drives measurable community economic impact
- Establish a trusted platform connecting community-conscious consumers with local businesses
- Build scalable technology infrastructure supporting 100+ businesses and 500+ consumers in first 6 months
- Generate $100K GMV within 12 months while maintaining platform sustainability
- Become the primary digital commerce platform for mid-sized communities (100K-500K population)

### Background Context
Based on the established Project Brief, Buy Locals addresses the fundamental disconnect between online shopping convenience and local business support. With 79% of consumers trusting local recommendations but lacking convenient transaction mechanisms, and 59% of local businesses planning increased technology spending, there's a validated market opportunity worth $93B growing at 13.5% CAGR. The platform differentiates from existing solutions by combining community trust mechanisms (like Nextdoor) with full marketplace functionality, focusing on measurable local economic impact rather than pure transactions.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The platform prioritizes community trust and local connection over transactional efficiency. Design emphasizes authentic business storytelling, community social proof, and intuitive discovery patterns that mirror how people naturally explore their neighborhoods. The interface should feel welcoming and approachable rather than corporate or sterile, reflecting the warmth of local business relationships.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Location-first navigation:** Users start with their current location and explore outward in concentric circles
- **Community validation:** Social proof through neighbor reviews and recommendations takes precedence over algorithmic suggestions
- **Business storytelling:** Rich media and narrative elements help businesses share their unique value propositions
- **Seamless booking flow:** Minimal friction from discovery to transaction completion, with clear confirmation and follow-up communication

### Core Screens and Views
- **Location Discovery Home:** Map-based interface showing nearby businesses with category filters and community activity indicators
- **Business Profile Pages:** Rich, story-driven business presentations with photos, services, availability, and community reviews
- **Booking/Reservation Interface:** Simple scheduling system with calendar integration and instant confirmation
- **Community Feed:** Local business updates, reviews, and neighborhood commerce activity
- **Business Dashboard:** Merchant management interface for profile updates, booking management, and performance analytics
- **User Profile:** Consumer preference management, purchase history, and community contribution tracking

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The platform will implement WCAG AA compliance to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities, including screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation support, and sufficient color contrast ratios.

### Branding
Design aesthetic emphasizes community warmth and local authenticity. Visual language should evoke neighborhood familiarity with earthy color palettes, local imagery, and typography that feels approachable rather than corporate. Photography focuses on real community members and authentic business environments rather than stock imagery.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The platform targets cross-platform deployment with React Native mobile apps for iOS and Android, plus responsive web applications accessible across desktop and mobile browsers. Mobile-first design approach ensures optimal experience on smartphones while maintaining full functionality on larger screens.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
The project will use a monorepo approach with shared components and utilities across mobile apps, web dashboard, and backend services. This supports consistent code sharing, unified deployment processes, and simplified dependency management across the full stack.

### Service Architecture
**Microservices within Monorepo:** The platform implements a microservices architecture for core functions (user management, payments, notifications, search) while maintaining monorepo benefits for development efficiency. Services communicate via RESTful APIs with GraphQL considered for complex data relationships.

### Testing Requirements
**Full Testing Pyramid:** Implementation includes unit tests for business logic, integration tests for service interactions, and end-to-end tests for critical user journeys. Automated testing covers payment processing, booking workflows, and cross-platform functionality. Manual testing protocols ensure user experience quality across devices and browsers.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Database Strategy:** PostgreSQL as primary database with Redis for caching, session management, and real-time features
- **Third-party Integrations:** Stripe for payment processing, Google Maps for location services, Twilio for SMS notifications, Mixpanel for analytics
- **Hosting Infrastructure:** AWS with auto-scaling capabilities, CDN for media assets, and environment separation for development, staging, and production
- **Security Framework:** JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Performance Optimization:** Image compression and CDN delivery, API response caching, database query optimization
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Comprehensive application monitoring, error tracking, and performance metrics collection
