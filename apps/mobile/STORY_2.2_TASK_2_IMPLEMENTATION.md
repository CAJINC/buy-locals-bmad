    // Process selected location
    navigation.navigate('BusinessSearch', { location: coordinates });
  }}
  showHistory={true}
  showSavedLocations={true}
  enableCurrentLocation={true}
/>
```

**Full Search Interface:**
```tsx
import { LocationSearchScreen } from '../components/discovery';

<LocationSearchScreen
  onLocationSelect={(coordinates, address, placeId) => {
    // Final location selection
  }}
  currentLocation={userLocation}
  showZipCodeExpansion={true}
/>
