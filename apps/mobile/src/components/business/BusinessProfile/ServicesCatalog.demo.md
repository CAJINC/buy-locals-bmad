## Enhanced Type System

### Core Types
```typescript
interface EnhancedService {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  pricing: {
    type: 'exact' | 'range' | 'quote';
    amount?: number;
    minAmount?: number;
    maxAmount?: number;
    currency: string;
  };
  duration?: number; // minutes
  availability: 'available' | 'busy' | 'unavailable';
  bookingEnabled: boolean;
  requirements?: string[];
  images?: string[];
  isActive?: boolean;
}

interface ServiceCategory {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  icon?: string;
  color?: string;
  serviceCount?: number;
}
```

## Integration with BusinessProfile

### Transformation Logic
- Converts existing `Business['services']` to `EnhancedService[]`
- Auto-generates categories from service data
- Maps basic pricing to comprehensive pricing structure
- Handles availability based on service active status

### Service Handlers
- `handleServicePress`: Shows service details (prepared for navigation)
- `handleBookService`: Booking integration preparation
